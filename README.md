# Dandelion Platform

Dandelion is an online storage platform built on top of Node.js and Nginx to serve and store user resources. It is
composed by a server, a web client and a [desktop client](https://github.com/Yarilo/dandelion-desktop).

Among others, it offers:
 - HTTPS/SSL
 - Permissions management, being able to share resources between several users
 - Encryption of files using AES 256
 - Ability to create P2P files (torrents) or links (magnets) from normal files to share them.
 - A REST API
 - A SPA application using AngularJS to dynamically load user's resources
